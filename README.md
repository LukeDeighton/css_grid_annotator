# CSS Grid Annotator

Automatically annotate CSS Grid items, so they are correctly positioned in IE11.

![Demo: before, after](demo.gif)

Please check back under the releases tab for recent releases.

## Transpile

The script in `dist` is derived via copy past of the script in `css_grid_annotation.html` to the [Babel website](https://babeljs.io/repl).
Make sure to select `es2015` and `stage-2`.

## TODO

- Make sure it also works when we add new elements via Javascript.
